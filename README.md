# 1. [Code Review] (https://youtu.be/se7c-5EMPs0)

In the code review that is linked I discuss the original files selected to be artifacts for the project. A breakdown of how each works and
how the code interacts is included during this. After talking about how the code works I discuss my plans for the enhancements to be done to the programs.

# 2. Software Design and Engineering: Artifact 1 CS 410 Final Project One

The first artifact is the first of two final projects from Computer Science 410 Reverse Software Engineering. In this artifact we initially converted a binary file to assembly then from there we created C++ code that could function. The initial program is simply an investment company with 5 clients that you have a few base functions that can be utilized. The first is to a short login sequence, the second is to display client list, and the final is to modify a client’s service choice there is also an option to exit the program. This program was originally made back in February of this year.

My reason for including this artifact is because it serves as a good way to show how I can build upon a program. The initial program I described above is very bare bones in my opinion. However due to the process we had to do in order to get an idea what the binary code became it made sense at the time since it would be hard to break down large amounts of binary by hand. I met the objectives I had hoped to while working on the enhancement for this program. However I ran into 2 issues I have yet to be able to figure out. Looking at the process of updating the program it caused a bit of confusion when I noticed the program was running fine before enhancements but once I expanded beyond the basics it started to break down. I learned that I had to convert a variable in order to get some of the functions to work properly as well as to allow the usage of my newly added functions as part of the enhancement.  The initial work goes appropriately but the conversion at a later point has an issue when you access the changing a client’s choice function. However the rest of the program works fine from what I can tell. The main additions were the adding of two new functions which allow for the addition or removal of new or existing clients. During my enhancements I also fixed security issues within the program to make it significantly harder to access the data.


# 3. Algorithms and Data Structures: Artifact 2 CS 260 Hashtable

The artifact for Algorithms and data structures is the Hash Table program from Computer Science 260: Data Structures and Algorithms. The program is based around utilizing the data stored within a Microsoft Excel document to display the Bids at an auction. The program also allowed for users to remove certain bids if they had the ID on hand. Originally the program was created a little over 2 years ago.

The reason for my inclusion of this program was to heavily focus in on both algorithms and data structures. The bids within the program are created as a database with multiple parts. Each point having a reference to different information within the program whether that be the bid ID, the bid itself or the name of the associated fund. Data structures being one of the main focuses of this artifact makes the inclusion of this program to be vital. Since it is a multi-part data structure it allows me to display my depth of understanding when it comes to data structures within C++. The program also utilizes a large amount of algorithms and functions in order to get the tasks done within itself. For instance there is an algorithm that iterates through the entire bid list to output all of the values within then reports the time it took for the process to occur. When it comes to my planned objectives with this artifact’s improvement I got most of what I wanted to done. I did have a bit of difficulty while coding due to simply not being familiar with the way the program worked which was caused by the long difference in time between when it was created and now. Enhancing the artifact has been a bit of a struggle overall since the information I had back then I do not fully remember and I am trying to work with what little information I have from the files myself. However I was able to add the function I was hoping to add which allows you to add bids to the program rather than solely getting new bids via loading the data.


# 4. Databases Artifact 3 DAT 220 Final Project Anaylsis Report

Artifact 3 is the Final Project from DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining. This project was based utilizing the provided database within a VM to demonstrate your ability to use JMP. This project was based around creating documentation in the hopes to improve a fictitious company to keep them from going under. Currently they are suffering a multi-year decrease in sales which needs to be prevented otherwise the company will go bankrupt within a few more years. Using the data from 500 customer surveys the project utilized JMP to make the data more digestible to the average viewer as well as make it easier to create a plan moving forward. The project was originally created about a year and a half ago.

 The reason for my inclusion of this artifact is because it shows a prime example of using databases and data mining within a controlled environment. Data mining is an important part of our information centered lives, allowing us to have experiences more catered to us as an individual or as a group of people in an area. The project was completed within a VM so I do not have the original data or values available however I worked with what information I had. For the most part the enhancements involved updating the analysis document and correcting a few errors I noticed I made at the time of creation. The actual data itself is done correctly so there was nothing to modify there.
